TODO: Make a class for renderable things to inherit from. There's a fair
      amount of boilerplate code currently being shared between ActivityView
      and ActivityMap, which should be stuck in its own class.

TODO: Display content! Clicking a node should show its content. I'm not
      certain on how that content should be stored; perhaps an iframe (then
      each entry has a separate HTML file).
      (Done!)

TODO: Separate the code of the activity map into two classes - one for
      handling the actual data of the node graph (probably a subclass), and
      one for managing UI state and rendering and such.
      (Done!)
